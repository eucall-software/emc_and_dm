. [sync_to_bastion] Add compile_c_files to DESY repo. 
. Compilation should include Cython compilation.

= Decided that phasing should be done on individual intensities, and not the merged copy because we don't know if the merged copy maximizes the log-likelihood of the data.
. Rename intermediate directories to recon_*
. Start_orient should be where the parameters are setup.

Fixes. Re-soft-link intensities?

Phasing related.
============================================================
. Write a simple function to parse object_recon.log, and plot its error.
. Have the leash parameter in modified DM as a user input.
. Reconstruction within individual run_recon folders. 
. Phasing.py should live within each EMC folder - this is used to produce a single average structure.
. What should runDM.py do?
    - Define an initial support, and keep that.
    - Watch and loop over results from object_recon, writing these to file.
        - Start recon. Generate object_recon.log. Generate min_state. Generate_output for support shrinking. 
. Phasing
. Debug phasing
    - the averaged Fourier projection seems "squished" to the side of the support. Could be the support projectioin that is problematic. 
    - shrinkwrapping of support doesn't seem repeatable from different initial runs.
